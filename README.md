# Call Center Metrics Analysis & IVR Optimization

## Overview
This project analyzes call center metrics such as **Average Handle Time (AHT)** and **Average Speed to Answer (AST)** to identify recurring issues and propose **IVR improvements**. The goal is to reduce agent intervention and optimize self-service options for common call reasons using **machine learning** and **NLP** (with **DistilBERT**).

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: Provides insights into AHT and AST during high-volume periods.
- **Machine Learning**: Predicts `primary_call_reason` using **Random Forest** for call transcripts.
- **IVR Improvements**: Proposes automation for frequent issues like **flight changes**, **seating preferences**, and **loyalty inquiries**.

## Output
- **Predictions**: The predicted call reasons are saved in test.csv.
- **IVR Recommendations**: Proposes specific improvements to automate frequent call reasons and reduce agent intervention.
